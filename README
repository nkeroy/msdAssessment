Do note that due to file size issue, I have only uploaded the src files here.

src -> Scenario 1 -> 

$ Takes in user input
$ Outputs temperature
$ Outputs weather and description  (in 3 hours interval)
$ Outputs correct weather/description according to API and json
$ Outputs nothing if invalid input, or date doesn't fall within API implementation

! No redux implemented
! No unit testing

src_2 -> Scenario 2 -> 

$ Takes in user input 
$ Creates new activity when 'Create Activity' button is clicked
$ View activities on right side of page
$ Deletes specific activity when 'Delete' button is clicked
  - Id attribute of Activity to allow accurate deletion
$ Redux implemented to keep track of state - state refers to the activities stored in the activities array

! User is unable to edit activity details that has been created before
! No unit testing
